# Signal detection project
Goal of the project : developping a system capable of classification, localization and detection of
radiocommunication signals on spectrograms
## Method
Overfeat <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6229.pdf">paper</a>
## Classification network

## Regression network

## HMI

The human-machine interface allows to select a spectrogram in the file system and can display the detected and localized signals with
bounding boxes and indicating the class of the selected spectrogram
